# Veri_RISC
The project focuses on understanding and building the VeriRISC architecture, featuring a three-bit opcode and five-bit operand, supporting eight instructions and a 32-location address space. The design includes a fetch-and-execute cycle split into eight phases for visualization and debug, with inputs like clock and reset, and an output halt signal
